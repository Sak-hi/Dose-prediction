# Large-Scale Clinical Data Processing in SAS and PK–PD Modeling in Julia

## Description
This project demonstrates an end-to-end clinical data analysis pipeline.
SAS is used for large-scale clinical data preprocessing and feature engineering,
while Julia is used for dose prediction and PK–PD modeling.

## Workflow
1. Raw clinical data preprocessing in SAS
2. Feature engineering and master table creation
3. Export of analysis-ready dataset
4. Dose prediction using linear regression in Julia
5. PK modeling using ODEs
6. PD modeling using Emax model
7. Combined PK–PD visualization

## Tools Used
- SAS (data preprocessing)
- Julia (statistical modeling & PK–PD)
- MIMIC-IV demo dataset
